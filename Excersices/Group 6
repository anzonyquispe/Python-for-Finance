----Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody, do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
In television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

---- You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go?
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Eres la niña de mis ojos tú
Eres todo lo que quiero yo
¿Una cerveza pa calmar la sed?, no
Mejor ser besado por su boquita, amor
Las tentaciones así como tú
Merecen pecados como yo
Ay, si tú quieres, solo da la lu' (yeh-yeh)
Tú sabes que no vo'a a decir que no
Ay, tienes la magia, tú sí tiene' una vainita
Que a mí me encanta, me enloquece (alright)
Dormir contigo fue amor a primera vista
Cuando bailabas así
Por el cuellito, besito y lengüita
Sé que te encanta, te enloquece
Sé que te encanta, te enloquece
Y a veces
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (sé que te encanta, te enloquece)
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
¡La plena!
Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh (óyelo), uh-uh, uh-uh
Oye, lo que pasa es que desde que vi tu cara
Me enamoro de ti toda, es que tú tiene' un no sé qué
Siento que te pasa lo mismo cuando te miro
¿Qué dices si nos parchamos a ver el amanecer? (¡Prr, uh!)
Quiero hacerte todo, quiero que tú seas mi toda
Le digo: "Sobelove", y luego viene y me lo soba (¡uah!)
Vamo a vernos luego, si no te gusta el infierno
¿Pa qué vienes al diablo y lo emboba'?
Ella, parcerita paisa; y yo, costeño coleto
En una baldosa la aprieto
Pa hablarte claro, cero visaje
Se sabe que tú eres puro veneno

--- Well I Wonder
Well, I wonder
Do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry (why?)

Well, I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half-die (why?)

Please, keep me in mind
Please, keep me in mind

Gasping, but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying, but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

Please, keep me in mind

Well, I wonder
Well, I wonder
Please, keep me in mind
Oh, keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
