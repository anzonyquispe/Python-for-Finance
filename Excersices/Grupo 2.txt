----"I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(We're gonna go on and on and on and on)
We are the champions, my friend"

--- "Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (on the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this life get no shame
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes, oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can (just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?"

--""Your eyes are glowing in the dark
Lighting the way to where you are
Ain't nothing pulling us apart
When we're together
Diamonds are everywhere, they're all that I can see
Close isn't close enough for you to be to me
I wanna be the air, be the air you breathe
Hold you forever
Ooh, all the stars above
Got nothing on you, baby
And your love is shining like the sky
But all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Summer, it never had a chance
Winter could melt inside your hands
You do it all because you can
Don't you forget it!
Ooh, all the stars above
Got nothing on you, baby
And your love is shining like the sky
But all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
Body on me
You know that I'm what you need
I'm your favorite recipe
Got a boss type of energy, yeah, yeah
Baby boy got my heart
Craving your love, your touch
Hope you don't mind
Tryna take a trip under the moonlight
You the one that I want
In my feels so deep, like I'm in a dream
And I don't want to wake up
And it's all because of you, I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
All I think about is you and us
You're all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I (you and I)
Dancing in the moonlight (yeah)
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but (you)
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I""

-- ""Eyes Without a Face""
I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream
Could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face
I spent so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face
When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car, go to Las Vegas
Ooh, gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinkin' it down, oh
I'm on a bus, on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realize
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face
Such a human waste
You're eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse
