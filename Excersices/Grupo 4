Birds of feather
"I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, alright
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothing left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, no
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day I die)
But if it's forever, it's even better
I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised"

I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (mm)
I already know your type, think you playin' your cards right (mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night (I be like, ooh)
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance

Was a time when that shit might've worked
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn
Now I'm grown, I know what I deserve
I still like dancin' with the lessons I already learned

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (mm)
I already know your type, think you playin' your cards right (mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion

Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance all night (I be like, ooh)
Dance all night, dance all night
Dance all night, dance, dance
