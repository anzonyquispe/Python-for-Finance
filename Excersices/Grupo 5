Clocks
"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'
You are
You are
Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin' come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, no, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are
You are
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go"

I Want to Know What Love Is
I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
(Whoa, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And this mountain, I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, oh-oh, oh (ooh)
I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
(I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(I know) I know you can show me
Let's talk about love (I wanna know what love is)
Love that you feel inside (I want you to show me)
I'm feeling so much love (I wanna feel what love is)
Oh, you know, you just can't hide (I know you can show me)
I wanna know what love is (let's talk about love)
I know you can show me
(I wanna feel it too)
I wanna feel what love is (oh, I wanna feel it too)
(And I know, and I know)
I know you can show me (show me love is real, yeah), yeah!
I want you to show me (and I wanna know, I wanna know, wanna know)
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel)
I know you can show me
