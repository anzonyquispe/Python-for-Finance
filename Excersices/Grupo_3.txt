----"I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
And I wonder (wonder, wonder, wonder)
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah"

----"Baby, come on get stoned, get stoned
Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside
Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, yeah
Heard about the week on the Dalymount seat, yeah
Baby, come on 'fore the going gets gone
Heard you lied to the Major, won't be long
Well I wish upon a wedding for a picture in the star
When they knock for ya don't forget who you are
Skinty Fia
Baby, come on whose side are you on?
I don't wanna see the queen
I already sing her song
While they're snuffing out hopes and they're blotting out suns
They claim to know the form in which genius comes, yeah
Baby, come on get your high heels on
It's the body is cold
It's the course is run
What artless living all this soft pain thrills
What calamities usher all our brilliance to the hills
Can you feel it?
Baby, come on get stoned, get stoned
Get inside it, inside it, inside it, inside
Get along, get along, get alone, get alone, yeah
Was it the weed or the moment that stoned ya?
Baby, come on get the hourglass on
I will dart into town, no I won't be long
If the talk's getting cold, we'll be chancing none
Well you know what I'm saying
Our day will come
Can you feel it?
Won't be long
Can you feel it?"

----"Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again
Wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this motherfuckin' record
I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all
Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better
Listen
Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say"

--- Adiós
----"Suspiraban lo mismo, los dos
Y hoy, son parte de una lluvia lejos
No te confundas, no sirve el rencor
Son espasmos después del adiós
Pones canciones tristes para sentirte mejor
Tu esencia es más visible
Del mismo dolor
Vendrá un nuevo amanecer, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Tal vez, colmaban la necesidad
Pero, hay vacíos que no pueden llenar
No conocían la profundidad
Hasta que un día no dio para más
Quedabas esperando ecos que no volverán
Flotando entre rechazos
Del mismo dolor
Vendrá un nuevo amanecer
Separarse de la especie por algo superior
No es soberbia, es amor
No es soberbia, es amor
Poder decir adiós
Es crecer, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh"
