Lyrics: "Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, "Oh"
I say, "Oh"
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, "Oh"
I cry, "Oh"
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh"

Lyrics: "Someday, someday
Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some days, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
(Hold up, hold up)
Someday, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday
Back way (yeah), way-way (yeah), burning (yeah), mm-mm
Uh, someday, I wanna tell everybody
Someday, I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Someday, oh (heatstroke)
Everyday I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Everyday I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Someday, we gon' set it off
Someday, we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all on a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday, the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes, I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Whoa, once again, I am a child
I let go (go) of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah (uh)
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free"
