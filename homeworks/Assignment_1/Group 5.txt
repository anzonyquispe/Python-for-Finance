Song: Sparks
Lyrics: "Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, "Oh"
I say, "Oh"
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, "Oh"
I cry, "Oh"
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh"

Song: Ghost Town
Lyrics: "Someday, someday
Someday I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some days, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
(Hold up, hold up)
Someday, some days, I remembered this on a Sunday
Back way (yeah), way-way (yeah), burning (yeah), mm-mm
Uh, someday, I wanna tell everybody
Someday, I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Someday, oh (heatstroke)
Everyday I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Everyday I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Someday, we gon' set it off
Someday, we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all on a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday, the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes, I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Whoa, once again, I am a child
I let go (go) of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah (uh)
I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free"

She- Harry Styles
Nine in the morning
The man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you
Like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32
Like he knows what to do
She (she)
She lives in daydreams with me (she)
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is (she, she)
He takes a boat out
Imagines just sailing away (away, away)
And not telling his mates (not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (wouldn't know what to say, to say)
She (she)
She lives in daydreams with me (she)
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is (she)
She (she)
She's the first one that I see (she)
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is (she, she)
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (his bed)
While he plays pretend (pretend)
So pretend (pretend)
She (she)
She lives in daydreams with me (she)
She's the first one that I see
And I don't know why
I don't know who she is (she, she)
She (she)
She's the first one that I see (she)
She lives in daydreams with me
And I don't know why
I don't know where she is (she, she)

Nombre de la canción: Lamento Boliviano 

Letra: "Me quieren agitar
Me incitan a gritar
Soy como una roca
Palabras no me tocan
Adentro hay un volcán
Que pronto va a estallar
Yo quiero estar tranquilo
Es mi situación
Una desolación
Soy como un lamento
Lamento boliviano
Que un día empezó
Y no va a terminar
Y a nadie hace daño
Uoh, io, io, io-uoh-oh, ye-eh-eh-eh, yeh-eh
Y yo estoy aquí
Borracho y loco
Y mi corazón idiota
Siempre brillará (Siempre brillará)
Y yo te amaré
Te amaré por siempre
Nena, no te peines en la cama
Que los viajantes se van a atrasar
Uoh, io, io, io-uoh-oh, ye-eh-eh-eh, yeh-eh
Y hoy estoy aquí
Borracho y loco
Y mi corazón idiota
Siempre brillará (Siempre brillará)
Y yo te amaré
Te amaré por siempre
Nena, no te peines en la cama
Que los viajantes se van a atrasar
Y yo estoy aquí
Borracho y loco
Y mi corazón idiota
Siempre brillará (Siempre brillará)
Y yo te amaré
Te amaré por siempre
Nena, no te peines en la cama
Que los viajantes se van a atrasar"
