When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out"

----"It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade"
