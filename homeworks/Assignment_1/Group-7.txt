----"It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade"

----"It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
