---Verte Así
---Tú sabes que me cuesta verte así
Así que, no paso ni un minuto
Sin pensar en ti
Tú sabes que detesto recordar
Que sufres como humano
Siendo tan angelical
Y sabes cuánto odio verte mal
Si tu risa es tan bonita
¿Para qué la vas a guardar?
Y sabes que yo solo quiero estar
Contigo para siempre
Pa' ayudarte a superar

---Is this thing on? (Word)
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (shit)
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free,
Uh, uh-uhm, so what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 5-0-1 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A
You know what
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my God, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
So what, we're fine
We don't care who sees
We don't care who sees
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

--- No more tears
----"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack
Your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger? Yeah
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, he who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush
So now that it's over, can't we just say goodbye? (Bye, bye, goodbye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say
I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love, I think I'm falling here
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
Is just a hand in the bush"

---Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
I'm on my back again, caught up in something
Could someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
Yeah, these leeches got to go
Yeah, I need a safe space
When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
Watching my candle burn, burn
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
Yeah, number one, two, three
You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
I'm on my back again, walking in the wind
I know how these things go (Oh)
