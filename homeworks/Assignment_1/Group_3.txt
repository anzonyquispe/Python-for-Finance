-- Lyrics : "I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
And I wonder (wonder, wonder, wonder)
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah"

-- Lyrics: "Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again
Wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this motherfuckin' record
I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all
Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better
Listen
Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say"
