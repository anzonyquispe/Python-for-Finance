-- Song : Lemon Tree
-- Lyrics : "I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wastin' my time, I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast, I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely, I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah (dah-di-di-dah)
I'm sittin' here, I missed the power
I'd like to go out, takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
And I wonder (wonder, wonder, wonder)
dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah
(Sing) dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, di-dah-dah
Dah-di-di-dah"

-- Lyrics: "Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again
Wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this motherfuckin' record
I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all
Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better
Listen
Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say"

-- Song : Don't Stop Me Now
-- Lyrics: "Tonight
I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy, so
Don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, explode
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey-hey-hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh-ooh-ooh) I like it
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) oh
Let loose, honey, alright
Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you (hey, hey)
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time (ooh, alright)
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all
Ah, da-da-da-da-da-da-ah-ah
Ah-da-da, ah-ah-ah
Ah, da-da, da-da-da-da-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh"

-- Song : Adiós
-- Lyrics: "Suspiraban lo mismo, los dos
Y hoy, son parte de una lluvia lejos
No te confundas, no sirve el rencor
Son espasmos después del adiós
Pones canciones tristes para sentirte mejor
Tu esencia es más visible
Del mismo dolor
Vendrá un nuevo amanecer, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Tal vez, colmaban la necesidad
Pero, hay vacíos que no pueden llenar
No conocían la profundidad
Hasta que un día no dio para más
Quedabas esperando ecos que no volverán
Flotando entre rechazos
Del mismo dolor
Vendrá un nuevo amanecer
Separarse de la especie por algo superior
No es soberbia, es amor
No es soberbia, es amor
Poder decir adiós
Es crecer, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh"
