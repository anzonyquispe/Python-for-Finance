--Song: Moonlight
--Lyrics:"Your eyes are glowing in the dark
Lighting the way to where you are
Ain't nothing pulling us apart
When we're together
Diamonds are everywhere, they're all that I can see
Close isn't close enough for you to be to me
I wanna be the air, be the air you breathe
Hold you forever
Ooh, all the stars above
Got nothing on you, baby
And your love is shining like the sky
But all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Summer, it never had a chance
Winter could melt inside your hands
You do it all because you can
Don't you forget it!
Ooh, all the stars above
Got nothing on you, baby
And your love is shining like the sky
But all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
Body on me
You know that I'm what you need
I'm your favorite recipe
Got a boss type of energy, yeah, yeah
Baby boy got my heart
Craving your love, your touch
Hope you don't mind
Tryna take a trip under the moonlight
You the one that I want
In my feels so deep, like I'm in a dream
And I don't want to wake up
And it's all because of you, I'm sprung (I'm sprung)
All I think about is you and us
You're all I want tonight
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I (you and I)
Dancing in the moonlight (yeah)
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but (you)
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You-hoo, you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
You and I
Dancing in the moonlight
Kiss you when the mood's right
Baby, I don't want nobody else, but
You and I"

--Song: Take me out (by Franz Ferdinand)
--Lyrics:"So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot, then we can die
Ah-ah-ah
I know I won't be leaving here
With you
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
I say, "You don't show"
Don't move, time is slow
I say
"Take me out
I say, "You don't know"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you
To take me out
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know, I won't be leaving here
With you
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say
"Take me out"
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you
To take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on
Take me out
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know, I won't be leaving here
With you"

--Song: Loco (Tu forma de ser)
--Lyrics:"Te vi llegar del brazo de un amigo
Cuando entraste al bar y te caíste al piso
Me tiraste el pingüino, me tiraste el sifón
Y estallaron los vidrios de mi corazón
Te vi bailar, brillando con tu ausencia
Sin sentir piedad, chocando con la mesa
Te burlaste de todos, te reíste de mí
Y tus amigos escaparon de vos
Y a mí me volvió loco tu forma de ser
(A mí) me volvió loco tu forma de ser
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad
Son estrellas en la noche de la mediocridad
Me volvió loco tu forma de ser
A mí me volvió loco tu forma de ser
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad
Son joyas en el barro de la mediocridad, eh
Y en esta hermosa noche
Para todos ustedes
El saxofonista de oro, el maestro
Pablo Rodríguez
Viniste a mí, tomaste de mi copa
Me sonreiste así, nadando en tu demencia
No sabía qué hacer, yo te traté de besar
Me pegaste un sopapo y te pusiste a llorar
Me vuelve loco tu forma de ser
A mí me volvió loco tu forma de ser
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad
Son estrellas en la noche de la mediocridad
Me volvió loco tu forma de ser
A mí me volvió loco tu forma de ser
Tu egoísmo y tu soledad
Son joyas en el barro de la mediocridad
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh"
