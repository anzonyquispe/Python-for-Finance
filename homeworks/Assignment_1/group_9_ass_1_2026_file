Major Tom (Coming Home) - Peter Schilling
Standing there alone
The ship is waiting
All systems are go
Are you sure?
Control is not convinced
But the computer
Has the evidence
No need to abort
The countdown starts

Watching in a trance
The crew is certain
Nothing left to chance
All is working
Trying to relax
Up in the capsule
Send me up a drink
Jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

Four, three, two, one
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Second stage is cut
We're now in orbit
Stabilizers up
Runnning perfect
Starting to collect
Requested data
What will it affect
When all is done?
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control
There is a problem
Go to rockets full
Not responding
Hello Major Tom
Are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on
We're standing by
There's no reply

Four, three, two, one
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Across the stratosphere
A final message
Give my wife my love
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship
The world is mourning
They don't realize
He's alive
No one understands
But Major Tom sees
Now the light commands
This is my home
I'm coming home

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming home
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming home
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming, coming home
Home
Home
Home
Home

That's not what I meant to say at all
I mean I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you
But that's not what I wanted to say at all
I mean I'm sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you
"Is it the Chorus yet?"
"No, it's just the building of the verse
So when the chorus does come, it'll be more rewarding."
I would speak to you in song
But you can't sing as far as I'm aware
Though everyone can sing as you are well aware
I keep so quiet it's hard to tell I'm alive
Everybody's swinging their hips
Everybody's giving the waitress tips
Everybody's dancing all of the dances
Everybody's dancing every dance now
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There's no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They're just two normal people
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
Well, so what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)
Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified, your body could fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them
We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place
And I know that I don't talk a lot
But I know that you don't care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We'll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance, when we
When we dance, when we
Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified your body call fall apart at any second

Hey Jude - The Beatles 
Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.
Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude...
(repeat X number of times, fade)

De qué callada manera - Pablo Milanés
De qué callada manera se me adentra usted sonriendo
Como si fuera la primavera, yo muriendo
Y de qué modo sutil me derramo en la camisa
Todas las flores de abril
¿Y quién le dijo que yo era?
¿Risa siempre y nunca llanto?
Como si fuera la primavera
No soy tanto
En cambio, qué espiritual que usted me brinde una rosa
De su rosal principal
De qué callada manera se me adentra usted sonriendo
Como si fuera la primavera, yo muriendo
Yo muriendo
¿Quién le dijo que yo era?
¿Risa siempre y nunca llanto?
Como si fuera la primavera
No soy tanto
En cambio, qué espiritual que usted me brinde una rosa
De su rosal principal
De qué callada manera se me adentra usted sonriendo
Como si fuera la primavera, yo muriendo
Yo mueriendo
De qué callada manera se me adentra usted sonriendo
Como si fuera la primavera, yo muriendo
Yo mueriendo
