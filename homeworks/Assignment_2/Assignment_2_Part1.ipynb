# 1. Print the first item of the second item of tuple1 (indexing)
# This line defines the tuple named tuple1, containing a string, a list, and a nested tuple.
tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

# This line selects the second element of tuple1 (index 1), which is the list, and then selects its first element (index 0).
print(tuple1[1][0])

# 2. Print the last item of the tuple1 object (indexing)
# This line accesses the last element of tuple1 using negative indexing (-1), which refers to the final item.
print(tuple1[-1])

# 3. Change "Orange" to "pink grapefruit" and comment whether it is possible
# This commented-out line illustrates an invalid operation, because tuples are immutable and do not support item reassignment.
# tuple1[0] = "pink grapefruit"  # TypeError: tuples do not support item assignment.

# This line constructs a new tuple by placing the replacement string first (as a 1-item tuple) and concatenating the remaining slice of tuple1.
tuple1_new = ("pink grapefruit",) + tuple1[1:]

# This line prints the newly created tuple, which reflects the desired change without modifying the original tuple1.
print(tuple1_new)

# 4. Print the length of tuple1 (length function)
# This line computes the number of top-level elements contained in tuple1 using the built-in len() function.
print(len(tuple1))

# 5. Sum all elements of tuple2 using map (no loops)
# This line defines the tuple named tuple2, which contains three lists of integers.
tuple2 = ([7, 8], [9, 1], [10, 7])

# This line applies sum() to each list inside tuple2 using map, and then sums those intermediate results into one total.
total = sum(map(sum, tuple2))

# This line prints the final scalar total obtained from summing all numbers across the nested lists.
print(total)

# 6. Create tuple3 with half the values of tuple2, preserving the same structure, using map
# This line constructs tuple3 by mapping over each inner list, halving each element via a nested map, converting each mapped result into a list, and finally converting the outer result into a tuple.
tuple3 = tuple(map(lambda lst: list(map(lambda x: x / 2, lst)), tuple2))

# This line prints tuple3 to display the transformed structure (a tuple of lists) with each original value divided by two.
print(tuple3)
